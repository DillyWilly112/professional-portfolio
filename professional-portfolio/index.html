    			<h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello My name is Frederick Vaca and I came from a small town in Ohio called New Philadelphia.There's not much to tell but here's my story!</p>
                <p>Before becoming a software developer I served four years in the Marine Corps as a Combat Engineer. During the time I spent in the Marine Corps I went to five different countries and went on two deployments. I was able to gain a lot of leadership knowledge and experience, as well as the ability to work well under pressure!</p>
